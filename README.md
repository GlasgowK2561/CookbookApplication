## Introduction:  

For many people, it may be difficult to decide just what to make for dinner. Despite having many recipes and foods that you enjoy, when it comes time to cook you cannot seem to remember any of them. This project's purpose is to create a web application that will allow users to access a personalized digital cookbook from anywhere, such as their smartphone or computer.  

## Objective:   

There are many applications on the market today and we want to introduce an application that will allow the busy family chef to create and maintain a personalized digital cookbook. 

## Target Customers:  

Single person – who needs to cook for one person and if wanting to cook for an entire family meal, they can freeze other portions later.  

The Person who cooks for the family– A person who needs to cook for the whole family, but not everyone likes the same things. They can make the meal versatile.  

A person who wants to cook more often instead of eating out 

Anyone can use the Busy Chef for just one person or multiple people. 

## Value/Benefit to the Client:   

This application can be a convenient way to meal plan, prep, and cook, which can make things easier for someone to cook when they want to buy food instead.  

## Features of the Application: 

1. Create, edit, delete recipes 
2. Add personalized tags to recipes to create specific searchable categories (e.g., Quick, Breakfast, Favorite, Pressure Cooker, Air Fryer) 
3. Mark ingredients as optional – a search to avoid that ingredient can still show this recipe
